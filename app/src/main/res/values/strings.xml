    <string name="game_instructions">The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. You play on a three by three game board. The first player is known as X and the second is O.
        Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either opponent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled.
        X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game.</string>

    <string name="game_instructions1">Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 or a 3×5 grid.
        The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.</string>
